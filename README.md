# Project Name :moneybag: :hammer:

auctiON

## Description :mag:

This is an auction website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items that other users have put up for auction. When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can earn more credits by selling items and use their credits to buy items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

## Usage :electric_plug:

To use the website, simply visit the site and register for an account. Once you have an account, you can start adding items to be auctioned off or bid on items that other users have put up for auction. You can also search through the listings to find items that you're interested in.

## Requirements :clipboard:

To use the website, you'll need a modern web browser and an internet connection.

To run the project locally, you'll need to have [VITE](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) installed on your machine. If you already have VITE installed, you can run the project with the following commands:
